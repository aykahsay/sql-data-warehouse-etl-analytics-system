# 📊 SQL Data Warehouse & ETL Analytics System

An end-to-end **data engineering and analytics system** that transforms raw ERP and CRM data into a structured, analytics-ready **data warehouse** using SQL Server. The project implements

- ⚙️ **Automated ETL Pipelines** using Python / SSIS for scheduled and scalable data ingestion
- 🕒 **Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD Type 2)** to track historical changes in customer and product data over time
- 🔄 **Real-Time Data Pipeline Integration** enabling near real-time analytics from source systems to the data warehouse
- 🏗️ Designed with modular architecture to support scalability and enterprise-level data processing

These enhancements simulate real-world data engineering systems used in modern analytics platforms.
a full **ETL pipeline, medallion architecture, and star schema modeling** to enable scalable business intelligence and decision-making.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Organizations often store data across disconnected systems (ERP, CRM, spreadsheets), leading to:
- Data inconsistency
- Slow reporting cycles
- Poor decision-making visibility

This project builds a centralized **data warehouse system** that integrates, cleans, and structures data for analytics.

---

## 🏗️ Data Architecture (Medallion Design)

The system follows a **Bronze → Silver → Gold architecture**:

### 🥉 Bronze Layer (Raw Data Ingestion)
- Raw ERP and CRM data ingested from CSV files
- Stored in original format for traceability
---

### 🥈 Silver Layer (Cleaned & Standardized Data)
- Data cleaning (null handling, duplicates removal)
- Standardization of formats (dates, currency)
- Integration of ERP + CRM datasets via CustomerID

---

### 🥇 Gold Layer (Business-Ready Data)
- Star schema implementation
- Fact and dimension tables optimized for analytics

## ⚙️ ETL Pipeline

### 🔹 Extract
- Data extracted from ERP and CRM systems (CSV files)

### 🔹 Transform
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Schema alignment across sources
- Joins using CustomerID
- Data validation and consistency checks

### 🔹 Load
- Data loaded into staging tables
- Final loading into fact and dimension tables

## 🧱 Data Modeling

Star Schema design:

- `FactSales`
- `DimCustomer`
- `DimProduct`
- `DimDate`
📌 Star Schema Data Model:
